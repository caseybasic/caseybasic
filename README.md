# Hello, my name is Casey! I am an undergraduate student at the University of North Georgia. I'm studying geospatial data analysis as well as environmental-sociological perspectives to provide solutions in the field of sustainable development, management, and conservation. 

# In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, foraging, reading, and meditation practice. I'm trying to get better at organism identification - [here's](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/caseybase) my iNaturalist if you'd like to connect with me there.
